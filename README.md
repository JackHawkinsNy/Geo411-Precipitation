R analysis of precipitation data for Buffalo and San Diego
Analyzing Annual Precipitation Probabilities in Buffalo and San Diego
This report examines the annual precipitation patterns in Buffalo and San Diego from 1940 to 2025, letting us see the rainfall over this alloted time period. Using yearly data, we calculate statistics such as mean and median and probabilities related to precipitation exceeding certain numbers. We evaluate the assumption of normality for precipitation and different years.
We used a couple of different methods, data source, summary statistics, probability, Binomial models, and assumption testing in our last questions.
The findings tell us that the probability of exceeding 42 inches a year in buffalo is 28%, and 23% for empirical. While the chance of San Diego having less than 4 inches is 8% and 3.5%, and the chance of 4-10 inches being 43% and 57%.
For tools I used models, graphs, and r studio
From what we saw, assuming the rainfall follows a normal pattern works pretty good for Buffalo, but it’s not so good for San Diego because their rain amounts are all over the place and not consistently on a trencd. The real data sometimes don’t match what the normal model says, especially for San Diego. Using the actual numbers from history helps check if the models are right or wrong. Knowing this stuff is important if we want to guess future rain better. Next time, we could try other ways to look at the data that fit San Diego’s rain better.
